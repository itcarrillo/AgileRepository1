Link to article: [The Lessons and Challenges of Managing Engineers with Ron Lichty](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/07/the-lessons-and-challenges-of-managing-engineers-with-ron-lichty/).

I think this article is well worth reading. Especially as a Computer Science student about to graduate and face the real world. Reading and understanding the situations that we are going to put ourselves through, can be enlightening when having to actually deal with them. The author does a good job in breaking down several categories which the engineering managers must take into account when... well... managing a team, of course.

My personal favorite, aside from the probably attractive 20% Time technique, is the "Tour of Duty" one. As someone who is through his 3rd internship in barely two years, I can see myself hopping onto different projects every once in a while and would want to have my managers understand that this is not because of some "millennial trend" or whatever they want to call it, but rather because I am fascinated of all the cool stuff that there is to do and learn out there Focusing on just one project for a period longer than 3 years can simply be exhaustive or shortsighted, in my opinion, since I would not want to miss out the opportunities to have an impact in multiple industries. Thankfully, Computer Science is one of those careers that allows one to hop onto different industries and sectors with a fairly steep learning curve since the job (developing software) doesn't change dramatically.

## Comment from Eric Lin
The article does expose readers to some interesting techniques to prevent engineering burn-out; while I doubt the effectiveness of some of the methods described, article author Adam Conrad does advise readers that this is not an easy change.

It really makes me question sometimes that whether I am productive, or simply making myself look busy most of the time.


## Comment on article by Ignacio Carrillo-Batalla

The article provides good insight into what 
motivates developers and what can be
done by managers to motivate them. I found it
interesting that the author gives good 
suggestions for motivating developers, while 
accepting inevitable truths, such as that 
all jobs cannot provide motivation through 
the promise of impact and that most 
developers change jobs frequently.
